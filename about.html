                <p class="profile-box-subtitle mt-1">Hi! I’m a fourth year Computer Science major at SJSU and 
                  this will be my third year being a part of SWE++! Growing up, I didn’t see many women 
                  in tech, and it often felt like coding wasn't meant for me. SWE++ means so much to me because
                  I want more girls to feel confident and excited about exploring the world of coding. Outside
                  of SWE++, I love drawing, listening to music, being outdoors, and playing with
                  my hamster! I look forward to hosting another 10-week program, and I can’t wait to inspire
                  and connect with a new group of young girls who are curious about engineering!</p>

                  and be confident in their capabilities! Outside of computer science, I enjoy roller skating and 
                  playing board games with friends and family.</p>
